# kallisto-pipeline

Jack Humphrey 2019

A snakemake workflow to:

* generate multiple Kallisto indexes from different transcript lists
*  run Kallisto to estimate transcript abundance with bootstraps
* run Sleuth to call differential isoform usage between groups

In addition this will contain projects using the results of this pipeline:

1. Estimate novel isoforms from AD brain isoseq reference

2. Estimate intron retention in human brains using KeepMeAround (Pimentel, 2019, unpublished)
