# Tiebrush pipeline

Runs tiebrush and tiecov. Shrinks down the size of BAM files by collapsing duplicate reads.

Tiecov creates BigWig and junction files for viewing coverage and splice junctions respectively.

TODO: add ability to collapse groups of samples together (ie all cases vs all controls)
