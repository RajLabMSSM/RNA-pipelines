MissingOutputException in line 40 of /sc/orga/projects/als-omics/NYGC_ALS/pipelines/collate_samples/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/sc/orga/projects/als-omics/NYGC_ALS/data/oct_2019_multiqc_report.html
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
